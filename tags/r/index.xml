      <description>MANOVA (Multivariate analysis of variance) is an extension of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) technique, which is used to compare means across different groups for a single dependent variable. In MANOVA, the dependent variables are correlated, and the analysis takes into account their&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The Kaplan–Meier estimator, often known as the product limit estimator, is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function using lifetime data. In this post, we will see how to estimate the survival function in this method using R.</description>

      <description>The normality of data is crucial in parametric hypothesis tests. Because all the parametric tests are based on normal distribution. The central limit theorem states that if the sample size is sufficiently large, the data will be normally distributed. But it may not be attained in all the cases. Typically, an analysis needs to be performed&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Principal Component Analysis - Theory and Application with R</title>
      <link>/2022/03/21/pca-introduction-r/</link>

      <guid>/2022/03/21/pca-introduction-r/</guid>
      <description>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique to transform the original set of variables into a smaller set of linear combination of variables so that most of the statistical information (variance) in the original data is preserved by those linear combinations. It accomplishes this by generating new uncorrelated variables that gradually maximize variance. Before diving into the PCA, there are a few things one should be aware of&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Complete guide to bar plot using ggplot2</title>
      <link>/2021/05/25/ggplot2-bar-plot/</link>

      <description>R is great for data visualization. One of the amazing packages in visualization in R is the ggplot2. Hadley Wickham created ggplot2 in 2005 as an implementation of Leland Wilkinson&amp;rsquo;s Grammar of Graphics. It divides graphs into semantic components like scales and layers.</description>

      <description>Markov Chain is a special type of stochastic process. It is a popular and straightforward way to statistically model a discrete-time, discrete space stochastic processes. In this post I will show a practical example of markov chain. Let’s try to map the movement of freelancer drivers in Dhaka. We can divide the area of Dhaka into three zones – North Dhaka, Middle Dhaka&amp;hellip;</description>
