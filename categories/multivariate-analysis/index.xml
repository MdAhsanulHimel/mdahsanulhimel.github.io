      <description>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique to transform the original set of variables into a smaller set of linear combination of variables so that most of the statistical information (variance) in the original data is preserved by those linear combinations. It accomplishes this by generating new uncorrelated variables that gradually maximize variance. Before diving into the PCA, there are a few things one should be aware of&amp;hellip;</description>
